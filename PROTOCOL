Here's a description of the protocol and filesystem used in CREST-fs

GET /path/blah/blah/myresource.blah

Is used to read the contents of a resource



GET /path/to/folder is also used to retrieve directory contents, if 'folder' is a directory, then CREST expects to be redirected to:

GET /path/to/folder/ <-- notice the trailing slash



Folder contents don't have to be in HTML, but resources within need to be described as follows:

<a href='resource'>resource</a>

Note that the 'href' attribute and the resource name are identical. "Links" where they are _not_ identical will not be counted as resources.


HTTP Redirects will be interpreted as 'symlinks'.

e.g. when you request http://something.com/blah/blah and get a redirect to http://something.com/foo/bar, that will be interpreted in the filesystem as "something.com/blah/blah is a symlink to something.com/foo/bar"

Received Last-Modified headers will read as mtimes

Etags will be used with conditional GET's to aggressive cache and fetch changes to files.

The X-Bespin-CREST: HTTP header is required on all pages! This is to detect a web service provider that is redirecting requests, ro messing with DNS.
